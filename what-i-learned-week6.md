# What I Learned Week 6

## Loops

In week six we learned loops. Loop are a useful tool for manipulating data in a string. Using loops you can sift through datatypes to extract what you want. 
### Loop types
So far we've learned while loop and for loops. They both do the same thing but depending on the syntax, one can be more appealing to the user.

## Arrays
An array is a database that stores data in each index.


## Conclusion
Week six consisted of challenging string manipulation using loops. It layed a foundation for the ins and outs of loops.
